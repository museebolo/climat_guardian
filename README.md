# Climat-Guardian
This project was made for the non-profit organization memoires-informatiques\
Memoires-informatiques has a lot of old computers and other electronic devices that need to be stored in a controlled environment\
The goal of this project is to monitor the temperature and humidity of the different rooms of the organization and to display the data on a web interface

## Installation
First thing you need to do is to clone the repository from the github page and install the dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/museebolo/climat-guardian.git
cd climat-guardian/login
composer install
cd ../Interface
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

	This is the list of all the files that end with .example
)
Once the repository is cloned you can remove the `.example` at the end of the following files:
- login/.env.example
- esp32/config/secrets.example.yaml
```bash
mv login/.env.example login/.env
mv esp32/config/secrets.example.yaml esp32/config/secrets.yaml
```

---
Now you want to generate a secret key for the jwt tokens used by the api
```bash
tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 </dev/urandom | head -c 32; echo
```

	This is the list of all the files that require to know the jwt secret key
)
You then want to copy the secret key and paste it the following files:
- login/.env
- postgrest.conf

---
Finally you can fill the `esp32/config/secrets.yaml` with the credentials of the wifi\

## Data transfer
Here are 2 diagrams that show how the data is transfered from the esp32 to the web interface
